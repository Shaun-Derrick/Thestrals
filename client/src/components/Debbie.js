            Debbie and Kery met at a Rainforest Alberta networking event and
            that connection is how Fusion came to be!

            Debbie is a self-employed data and accounting consultant and an
            active member of Data for Good YYC, CivicTechYYC, and Rainforest
            Alberta.

            {" "}
            In 2017 Debbie began to explore the tech sector in Calgary by
            attending 100â€™s of events/meetup/conferences and discovered their
            personal and professional value. What she also discovered is these
            events are posted on various platforms (Eventbrite, Meetup, and
            individual organization websites) and how time consuming it can be
            to find and keep track of numerous events.{" "}
          </p>
          <br />
          <p id="profileText">
            This is how she came up with the idea for a central calendar that
            lists relevant networking and educational events in one place. A
            one-stop shopping platform to find events to attend so no one misses
            out.

            When Debbie is not working on Fusion-Alberta, you can find her
            fanatically riding her bike, a new hobby she gained thanks to
            COVID-19.
