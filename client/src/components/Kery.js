          <p id="profileText">
            Kery is a born and raised Calgarian who loves collaboration and
            teamwork. An avid hockey fan, Kery has always found herself drawn to
            roles that are rooted in people working together. Kery has spent her
            career working for Calgary hardware/software companies, in roles
            such as Client/Technical Support Specialist and as a Technical
            Writer. Since day one of the EvolveU program, Kery has been a pillar
            of positivity/enthusiasm for the learners in the cohort. She
            believes that technology has the potential to make life better for
            people.

            For the final project in the program, Kery is working with her team
            to develop "FUSION," an app that makes innovation/tech networking
            events more accessible. In fact, this project was inspired by a
            fellow Rainforest Alberta colleage and industry professional Debbie
            Butt, who asked Kery and her team to help build an app to bring
            these events together in one place.
          </p>

          <p id="profileText">
            Kery's advice to future learners in the program is "Don't get down
            on yourself and remember that the challenging times teach you the
            most. Regardless of the struggle you WILL find a way out. Reach out
            for support when you need it."
