            Shaun grew up in Turner Valley and spent many hours toiling on the
            family farm near Longview. As an energy professional, Shaun has
            worked in Project and Operations Management, OHS, and as a Technical
            Recording Field Specialist. His various roles in the energy industry
            have allowed him to work on challenging projects in many countries
            around the globe. After working in Australia for 7 years, Shaun
            returned to AB and recognized that it was essential for him to learn
            new skills to open up more job opportunities. A lifelong passion for
            tech inspired Shaun to apply to the EvolveU program to explore a
            sustainable career in tech/innovation.

            For the final project, Shaun is working with his team to develop
            "FUSION," an app that consolidates innovation/tech networking events
            in Alberta. Post program, Shaun would like to explore roles in
            Product Management and he is particularly interested in the
            integration of technology into the agricultural, forestry, and
            renewable resource industries.

            For future learners, Shaun shares that "Even though change can make
            you feel anxious, it's the door to new and exciting opportunities.
            Society often measures learning on a stringent baseline of success
            or failure. My experience at EvolveU has taught me that when
            learning new skills the primary goal of continuous improvement
            ultimately includes failure as well as achievement. Failure is as
            equally important as success is in the learning process. If nothing
            else it teaches us resilience as well as how not to do things in the
            future. You will never succeed if you do not try.... and the only
            sure path to failure is to never try at all."
          </p>

            EvolveU is grateful for Shaun's open mindedness, love for learning,
            and collaborative and kind nature. He is truly a team player!
